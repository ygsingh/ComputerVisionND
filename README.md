# Computer Vision Nanodegree

This program is designed to enhance your existing machine learning and deep learning skills with the addition of computer vision theory and programming techniques. These computer vision skills can be applied to various applications such as image and video processing, autonomous vehicle navigation, medical diagnostics, smartphone apps, and much more.

## Reference Material
- Code exercises and materials for Udacity's Computer Vision Nanodegree program is available [here](https://github.com/udacity/CVND_Exercises).


## Course 1: Introduction to Computer Vision

- Lesson 1:  Introduction to Computer Vision
- Lesson 2: Image Representation and Analysis
- Lesson 3: Convolutional NN Layers
- Lesson 4: Features and Object Recogition
- Lesson 5: Image Segmentation

### Project 1: Facial Keypoint Detection
Use image processing techniques and deep learning techniques to detect faces in an image and find facial keypoints, such as the position of the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face.

## Course 2: Advanced Computer Vision and Deep Learning

- Lesson 1: Advanced CNN Architectures
- Lesson 2: Recurrent Neural Networks
- Lesson 3: Attention Mechanisms
- Lesson 4: Image Captioning

### Project 2: Automatic Image Captioning
Combine CNN and RNN knowledge to build a deep learning model that produces captions given an input image.

## Course 3: Object Tracking and Localization

- Lesson 1: Object Motion and Tracking
- Lesson 2: Optical Flow and Feature Matching
- Lesson 3: Robot Localization
- Lesson 4: Graph SLAM

### Project 3: Landmark Detection and Tracking
Use feature detection and keypoint descriptors to build a map of the environment with SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping). Implement a robust method for tracking an object over time, using elements of probability, motion models, and linear algebra.
